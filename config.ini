# FFmpeg command template for RTMP streaming to OvenMediaEngine.
# Use ${seq} as a placeholder for stream sequence number.
# The tester will execute the command by incrementing ${seq} from 0 by 1 each time.
# Make sure to verify the OvenMediaEngine address (host, port, app name).

# Example for RTMP:
ffmpeg_command = ffmpeg -re -stream_loop -1 -i input.mp4 -c copy -f flv rtmp://localhost:54935/app/stream_${seq}

# Example for SRT:
# ffmpeg_command = ffmpeg -re -stream_loop -1 -i sample-video.mp4 -c copy -f mpegts srt://localhost:9999?streamid=default/app/stream_${seq}
